**Dual-Samsung Android migration tool for Windows.** Drives two USB-connected Galaxy phones at the same time and copies apps, media, settings, Wi-Fi, default app roles, and applies a debloat profile when moving from a new device to a freshly-reset old one. No root, no Samsung account, no cloud.

Built because Samsung Smart Switch is sequential (one phone at a time), one-direction-blessed (old→new), and refuses to debloat.

## What it does

| Domain | What gets copied | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| **Apps** | All `-3` user apps + their split APKs | `pm path` → `adb pull` → `pm install-create/-write/-commit -i com.android.vending --install-reason 4` |
| **Media** | DCIM, Pictures, Movies, Download, Documents, Music, Ringtones, Notifications, Alarms | Incremental manifest diff + `adb pull/push` |
| **Settings** | AOSP `secure`/`system`/`global` + reviewed safe Samsung One UI keys (AOD, edge panels, display, sound, navigation) | `settings list` snapshot diff + safety-corpus-gated `settings put` |
| **Debloat** | Apply [AppManagerNG](https://github.com/SysAdminDoc/AppManagerNG)'s 5,481-entry curated bloat list | `pm disable-user --user 0` (reversible) |
| **Wi-Fi** | Saved networks, including pre-shared keys on Android 11+ via the app_process agent, plus a QR-bridge fallback | `getPrivilegedConfiguredNetworks()` as the shell user, `cmd wifi` otherwise, or a `WIFI:T=WPA;S=…;P=…;;` QR |
| **Roles** | Default dialer, SMS, browser, launcher, assistant | `cmd role add-role-holder` |

## What it cannot do (and why)

Third-party app **private data** (banking, messengers, game saves, login sessions) does not transfer. Android's security model prevents reading `/data/data/<pkg>/` without root, and `adb backup` was effectively neutered in Android 12. For app-data migration, run Samsung Smart Switch alongside PhoneFork as a complementary step.

Knox-bound data (Secure Folder, Samsung Wallet payment tokens, enterprise containers) is intentionally inaccessible by design. Set those up again on the destination.

For SMS, PhoneFork's pre-flight checks verify the default SMS role and the Samsung Messages -> Google Messages transition state before any helper-assisted SMS workflow.

For Samsung Gallery, pre-flight checks use Microsoft's September 30, 2026 direct OneDrive sync cutoff and verify OneDrive camera-backup prerequisites where Android exposes them.

## Official transfer companions

PhoneFork complements first-party transfer flows instead of trying to replace them. Use Samsung Smart Switch for private app data and OEM-managed domains, Google Messages for the Samsung Messages transition, OneDrive for Gallery cloud sync, Quick Share for one-off large files, and Samsung Wallet for account- and device-bound payment setup. For Android/iOS moves, follow the official QR/session transfer flow; PhoneFork's open ADB workflow fills in the auditable local work that those services do not cover.

## Android developer verification (Sept 2026)

Google's [developer verification](https://developer.android.com/developer-verification/guides/faq) requirement applies to **Play / sideload installs of unverified developers**. It does **not** apply to packages installed via ADB. PhoneFork installs its helper with `adb install`, so the verification gate is not on the critical path. If you sideload the helper outside ADB you may be prompted by your launcher to verify the developer; that is normal.

## Install

The current GitHub prerelease is [v0.9.4-pre](https://github.com/SysAdminDoc/PhoneFork/releases/tag/v0.9.4-pre). Download the WPF ZIP for the desktop app, or the CLI ZIP for terminal use.

Requires the **.NET 10 Desktop Runtime** ([download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/10.0)). The zip is framework-dependent (~10 MB).

The bundled `tools/adb.exe` ships with the app. You don't need an Android SDK on your PC.

The Windows ZIPs are built locally and aren't Authenticode-signed, so Windows may show a SmartScreen warning. The helper APK is a signed release build. Its private signing key is stored outside the repository and is never included in source or release downloads. Verify any download against `SHA256SUMS` before running it.

## Usage

1. Plug **both** phones in via USB. Accept the "Allow USB debugging?" prompt on each.
2. Open PhoneFork. Both devices appear in the top bar; pick which is **Source** and which is **Destination**.
3. For wireless debugging, open **Wireless ADB** in the device bar, pair with the phone's pairing endpoint/code, then connect to the wireless ADB endpoint.
4. Open the tab for whatever you want to migrate. Each tab has a **dry-run** preview before **Apply**.
5. Audit log writes one NDJSON line per operation to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\PhoneFork\logs\audit-YYYY-MM-DD.log`.
6. Completed migration/apply flows write JSON receipts to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\PhoneFork\receipts`.

## CLI

```bash
phonefork devices                          # list connected
phonefork apps list --device R5CY34G070L   # enumerate user apps
phonefork apps report --device <serial> [--json]
phonefork apps migrate --from <src> --to <dst> [--dry-run] [--allow-multi-user]
phonefork media sync   --from <src> --to <dst> [--checkpoint path] [--report path]
phonefork settings dump --device <serial> --out settings.json
phonefork settings diff --src source.json --dst dest.json [--show-safety]
phonefork settings apply --from <src> --to <dst> [--allow-multi-user] [--include-uncatalogued-settings]
phonefork debloat apply --device <serial> --profile aggressive [--overlay-feed feed.json --overlay-sha256 <sha256>] [--allow-multi-user]
phonefork backup inspect <path> [--json]
phonefork backup export --device <src> --out backups [--package <pkg>]
phonefork backup install --to <dst> --backup <dir> [--dry-run] [--allow-multi-user]
phonefork helper install   --device <serial>       # installs and grants runtime permissions
phonefork helper export    --device <serial> --category sms --out helper-export
phonefork helper agent     --device <serial> [--op ping]   # push-and-run agent, shell UID
phonefork platform-watch [--json]
phonefork pair <ip:pair-port> <code>
phonefork connect <ip:connect-port>
```

`apps report` explains per-app APK installability, private-data limits,
OBB/external-data payloads, and source/provenance posture so a user can see
what PhoneFork can and cannot transfer before wiping the source.

Package, settings, role, permission, appop, and backup-install writes are
primary-user-only by default. PhoneFork probes Android user/profile topology
first and refuses work-profile or secondary-user devices unless the CLI caller
explicitly passes `--allow-multi-user`; the WPF cockpit blocks those writes for
now.

Settings apply is corpus-gated. By default, PhoneFork applies only reviewed safe
Samsung/Android settings and reports review-only, blocked, and unknown keys in
the read-only diff. CLI callers can opt into non-blocked uncatalogued keys with
`--include-uncatalogued-settings`.

Receipts use hashed device IDs and include operation type, PhoneFork version,
category counts, failures, warnings, and rollback/evidence paths such as debloat
snapshots, media checkpoints, and media evidence reports.

`platform-watch` is a release-planning check for moving official flows:
Android cross-platform transfer metadata, Apple iOS-to-Android transfer,
Seedvault ROM integration limits, and PhoneFork open-archive implications.

Media sync resumes from the checkpoint JSON, writes an evidence report JSON, and emits Quick Share guidance only for single large ad hoc files where a full ADB sync is not the best tool.

Debloat overlay feeds are optional JSON hotfixes for OEM/package safety
changes. They must be verified with `--overlay-sha256` or a sibling
`.sha256` file; without an overlay, PhoneFork uses the embedded offline
AppManagerNG/UAD-NG dataset and bundled source-backed overrides.

The two formats are not interchangeable: App Manager writes an encrypted meta_v5.am.json beside a plaintext info_v5.am.json, and PhoneFork writes phonefork-backup.v1.json. Neither tool reads the other's backups.
